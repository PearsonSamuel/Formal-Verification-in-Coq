# Formal-Verification-in-Coq
This work was part of an introduction to formal verification of software using CoqIDE, a well-known proof assistant.

The work in Coq was done using the Hoare Logic implemented here https://github.com/coq-community/hoare-tut , by Sylvain Boulm√©.

I include here the implementation and partial and total correctness proofs of an imperative factorial algorithm.
